## Core Concepts

John the Ripper is a fast password cracker that supports many hash formats and can operate in multiple cracking modes. It is typically used in conjunction with helper tools that extract hashes from protected files like ZIP, RAR, and SSH private keys.

## Main Commands and Flags

### Basic John Usage

john <hash_file>

    Starts cracking using the default mode.

    John will auto-detect the hash type unless --format is specified.

- Wordlist Mode

john --wordlist=<path> <hash_file>

    Uses a specified wordlist (e.g. rockyou.txt) to attempt cracking.

Example:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

- Show Cracked Passwords

john --show <hash_file>

    Displays any passwords that have already been cracked and stored in Johnâ€™s .pot file.

- Specify Hash Format

john --format=<hash_type> <hash_file>

    Use this when John doesn't auto-detect the hash correctly.

    Examples:

        --format=raw-md5

        --format=sha256

        --format=zip

        --format=rar

        --format=ssh

## Archive Cracking Tools
### zip2john

Extracts a hash from a password-protected .zip file and outputs it in a format John understands.

zip2john secret.zip > zip_hash.txt

Then crack it:

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt

### rar2john

Same concept, but for .rar archives.

rar2john archive.rar > rar_hash.txt

Crack:

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt rar_hash.txt

### ssh2john

Extracts the hash from an SSH private key (e.g., id_rsa) that is password protected.

ssh2john id_rsa > ssh_hash.txt

Crack it with:

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt ssh_hash.txt
