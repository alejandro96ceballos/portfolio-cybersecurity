# OWASP Top 10 - 2021


## The Top 10 Risks

1. **Broken Access Control**: Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced.
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Previously known as "Sensitive Data Exposure," focuses on failures related to cryptography.
3. **Injection**: Includes SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection vulnerabilities.
4. **Insecure Design**: Risks related to design flaws.
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Insecure default configurations or incomplete configurations.
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Using components with known vulnerabilities.
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Issues with authentication mechanisms.
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Lack of proper logging and monitoring.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Exploiting server-side applications to make HTTP requests to arbitrary domains.

## Security Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Keep software and dependencies up to date.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper access control mechanisms.
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to incidents.
