# JavaScript Essentials



## Key Concepts

- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values.
- **Functions**: Blocks of code designed to perform particular tasks.
- **Objects**: Collections of properties and methods.
- **Loops**: Execute a block of code multiple times.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with the Document Object Model to dynamically change content.

## Practical Applications

- **Dialog Functions**: `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()` used for user interactions.
- **Control Flow Statements**: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while` used to control the execution flow.
- **Minified Files**: Compressed JavaScript files to reduce load times.

## Security Considerations

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts.
