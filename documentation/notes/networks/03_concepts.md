## ðŸ“š Key Concepts

- **OSI Model:** A conceptual framework with 7 layers (Physical to Application) that standardizes communication functions.
- **TCP/IP Model:** Practical model for internet networking with 4 layers (Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application).
- **IP Addressing:** Unique identifier for each device on a network. Includes IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Subnetting:** Divides a large network into smaller, manageable segments.
- **Gateways and Routing:** Gateways act as exits to other networks; routing determines the best path for packet delivery.

## ðŸ’¡ Commands and Tools

- `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ifconfig`, `ip a` (Linux): View IP configuration.
- `ping <target>`: Check connectivity with another host.
- `traceroute <host>` / `tracert <host>`: Trace the route taken to a destination.
- `netstat`: Display network connections and ports.

## ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes

- Understanding how the OSI and TCP/IP models map protocols and hardware is essential for network troubleshooting.
- Basic commands are invaluable for verifying connectivity and diagnosing network issues.
