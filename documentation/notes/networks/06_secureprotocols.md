## ðŸ’¡ Commands and Tools

- `ssh user@host`: Connect securely to a remote machine.
- `openssl s_client -connect host:443`: Inspect TLS certificates.
- VPN clients: `openvpn`, `wireguard`, OS-native options.

## ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes

- Proper implementation of these protocols is vital for maintaining confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.
- Certificates, key pairs, and trusted authorities are central to how TLS/SSL operates.
